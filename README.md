# comparing-multiplexers
Using same type of nmos and pmos transistors, we build a nand gate and a tri-state buffer.
we write a testbench for them to make sure they fonction as expected.
then we build a multiplexer(mux) with each of these elements.
finally we test and compare 2 mux in a testbench.
we aim to compare the efficiency and the worst case delay of multiplexers.
